*Did you know: Tue is pronounced as "two-aye"?*

Hello, my name is `Tue (2A)`. I'm a rising senior at `Tufts University` majoring in `Mechanical Engineering`. My skills and interests are in electromechnical design, product testing, and brain-computer interfaces.

Currently, I work at [`Bray Lab PALLS`](https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/) where I help Tufts' students brainstorm and fabricate their most ambitious designs to life! 

Check out all my projects in the section below or sorted by [hardware](/tags/hardware), [software](/tags/software), [electronics](/tags/electronics/), etc.
