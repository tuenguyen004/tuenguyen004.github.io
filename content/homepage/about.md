**Hi there!** My name is `Tue Nguyen (Hello Me90)`

I am a Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science student at Tufts University's Class of 2023 🐘🐘🐘.

My interests are focused in electromechanical design, 3D modeling, and anything related to robotics. 
Outside of hardware development, I love spending time outdoors, **vibing** to R&B/Hip-Hop music, and cooking all kinds of healthy dishes!
