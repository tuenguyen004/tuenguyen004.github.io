:::::::::::::::::::: *a bit more about 2A* ::::::::::::::::::::

I design robust and intuitive [electromechanical](/tags/hardware/) systems!

From three-pound BattleBots to a soft-robotics exoskeleton, I'm experienced in both working from scratch and modifying existed technology to create functional prototypes. Familiar with various aspects of [robotics](/tags/robotics/) and [fabrication](/tags/fabrication/) methods, I can then turn them into dynamic and responsive systems. 

And I'm not afraid to dabble in [software](/tags/software), having written code that controls hardware prototypes and even devised a mathematical model with biometric datasets.

Outside of hardware engineering, I love [sketching and 3D modeling](/tags/3d-design) anything I can touch and imagine. I also educate others how to do the same, [teaching K-12 students](/tags/teaching/) how to bring their project ideas into reality.

In my free time, I can be found modifying my [Ender3Pro](/tags/ender3pro/) or playing board games with friends!

I'm passionate about solving problems through engineering and design. To me, the combination of purposeful craftsmanship and efficient workflow has the power to make the world a much better place. The opportunity to make that come to true one day is what drives me to wake up, learn, and create everyday!
